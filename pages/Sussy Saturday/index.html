                Here are some fun facts about Sussy Saturday.
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>It began with the Nintendo Mod Policy Change Team Discord server, where some used to play Among Us in the voice chats</li>
                <li>Starting with Sussy Saturday 10, banners were created by Jerby for each Sussy Saturday, with descriptions starting with Sussy Saturday 17</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting with Sussy Saturday 28, banners started being created by Fangirl as well</li>
                    <li>Since the beginning of Fangirl's involvement with the banners, there have been banners that either have the wrong number or do not have any number at all. Those include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>32 (wrong number (it says 34 instead of 32))</li>
                        <li>37 (no number)</li>
                        <li>38 (no number)</li>
                        <li>41 (no number)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>The Sussy Saturday descriptions prior to Sussy Saturday 17 may be lost forever</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Swift is the only member to have participated in every single Sussy Saturday, from Sussy Saturday 1 to Sussy Saturday 41. Jerby has missed one Sussy Saturday</li>
                <li>There have been several permanent colour changes of members. These include:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rimea (Green -> Coral)</li>
                    <li>Mullkaw (Purple -> Cyan)</li>
                    <li>iHarv (Pink -> Red)</li>
                    <li>Turbo (Red -> Purple)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>In addition to the above, Swift and Toms often share the same colour of Blue, and when either one of them wants to be Blue, they will change their colour to the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swift (Blue -> Black)</li>
                    <li>Toms (Blue -> Cyan</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Sussy Saturday 41 is the only Sussy Saturday to have not actually happened, despite having a banner and description. This is due to the fact that there was drama in the NSMBW modding community, and everyone was too caught up in it to remember</li>
            </ul>
